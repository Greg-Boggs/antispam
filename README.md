## Free open-source Antispam API 

The Antispam API is built with Symfony based on the B8 'Bayesian' like library. You can find out more about the algorithm behind this project in the [Library ReadMe](https://github.com/Greg-Boggs/b8).

To use this software, you'll need to install the B8 database then just download the repository then use composer!

	composer install

A sample SQL script is provided in the B8 install folder that will be in your vendor folder. I will provide a sample database in the near future.

### Contributions Welcome
Improvements to the filtering algorithm are welcome. If you're good with autoloading classes, the B8 example script could use some fiddling.
